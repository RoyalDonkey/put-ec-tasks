# Greedy heuristics

Implement three methods:

- Random solution
- Nearest neighbor
- Greedy cycle

adapted to our problem.

For each greedy method generate 200 solutions starting from each node. Generate
also 200 random solutions.

The report should contain:

- Description of the problem
- Pseudocode of all implemented algorithms
- Results of a computational experiment: for each instance and method min, max
  and average value of the objective function.
- 2D visualization of the best solution for each instance and methods. Cost of
  nodes should be presented e.g. by a color, greyscale, or size.
- (link to) source code
- Conclusions
